        <h1>6 Tips For Mastering The Dog Walk</h1>
        <p>Here are six dog training tips on how to walk your dog and master the dog walk. When I’m out with my dog pack, I often walk about ten dogs at a time, sometimes even off-leash if I’m in a safe area. People are amazed by this, but it’s simple: the dogs see me as their pack leader. This is why dogs follow me wherever I go. Here are 6 tips for mastering the dog walk.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Walk in front of your dog</li>
                <p>Walking in front of your dog allows you to be seen as the pack leader. Conversely, if your dog controls you on the walk, he’s the pack leader. You should be the first one out the door and the first one in. Your dog should be beside or behind you during the walk.</p>
            <li>Use a Short Dog Leash</li>
                <p>This allows you to have more control. Attaching the leash to the very top of the neck can help you more easily communicate, guide, and correct your dog. If you need additional help, consider a great dog collar. Always keep your dog’s safety in mind when giving corrections.</p>
            <li>Give Yourself Enough Time for the Dog Walk</li>
                <p>Dogs, like humans, are diurnal, so taking walks in the morning is ideal. I recommend setting aside thirty minutes to a full hour. The specific needs of each dog differ. Consult your vet and keep an eye on your dog’s behavior to see if his needs are being met.</p>
            <li>How to Reward Your Dog During the Walk</li>
                <p>After your dog has maintained the proper state of mind, reward him by allowing him to relieve himself and sniff around. Then you need to decide when reward time is over. It should always be less than the time spent focused on the walk.</p>
            <li>Keep Leading, Even After the Walk</li>
                <p>When you get home, don’t stop leading. Have your dog wait patiently while you put away his leash or take off your shoes.</p>
            <li> Reward Your Dog After the Walk</li>
                <p>By providing a meal after the walk, you have allowed your dog to “work” for food and water.</p>
